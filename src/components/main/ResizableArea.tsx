            Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and leaving
            jokes all over the place: under the king&apos;s pillow, in his soup, even in the
            royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldn&apos;t seem to stop Jokester. And
            then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes left by
            Jokester were so funny that they couldn&apos;t help but laugh. And once they
            started laughing, they couldn&apos;t stop.
